					<p>
					Sam Emaminejad received his BASc (2009) and MS (2011) degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo and Stanford University, respectively. He is pursuing his PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University where he is working toward his thesis at Stanford Genome Technology Center (SGTC). Sam has previously worked as an ASIC and Analog Designer in semiconductor companies such as STMicroelectronics and Analog Devices and is the co-author of Supplemental Problems and Solutions Manual for Microelectronic Circuits (Sedra/Smith, 2013). Sam was the recipient of the Best Paper Award of the IEEE Sensors conference in 2013. His current research at SGTC is primarily focused on three projects as described below: 
					<br/>
					<b>1. Ultra-sensitive electronic multiplexed protein biosensor</b>
					<br/>
					By integrating microfluidics with electrical impedance sensing technology we measure the abundance and functionality of a panel of protein biomarkers.  To perform the multiplexed functionality, a bead-based assay is performed in an array format along single channel. Each element of the array is functionalized with a different antibody, targeting a specific antigen in the subsequently introduced sample. The captured antigen will then be sandwiched by injecting secondary antibody that is tagged with micron-sized bead. Upon performing the assay, immuno-bound beads on each element of the array are eluted selectively from the array and are quantified downstream (one element at a time). In this approach to electronically modulate the protein-protein interactions, a robust and addressable electrokinetic actuator was required. For this purpose, Dielectrophoresis (DEP) was a potential candidate as it is amenable to microfluidics applications. DEP is a force exerted on polarizable particles in a non-uniform electric field. However, conventionally, DEP devices have weak actuation forces that are significantly smaller than protein-protein interactions. Through improved nanofabrication and novel modeling and optimization techniques we have made possible the design and fabrication of high voltage, corrosion-resistant electrodes which enhanced the strength of inherently weak DEP force by two orders of magnitude.

					<b>2. Contactless impedance flow cytometry for low-cost diagnostic</b>
					<br/>
					This system offers a cost-effective approach to implement a disposable microfluidic contactless impedance cytometer. Conventional methods for single cell impedance cytometry use microfabricated electrodes in direct contact with the buffer to measure changes of its electrical impedance when cells pass through the applied electric field. However, they require expensive microfabrication of electrodes, and also, the fabricated electrodes cannot be reused without thorough and time-consuming cleaning process. Here, we introduced a novel approach to allow for single cell impedance cytometry using electrodes that can be reused, without the need for microfabrication of the electrodes. This disposable device can be potentially inserted onto a printed circuit board (PCB) which has a non-disposable, yet inexpensive, electronic reading apparatus. This significantly reduces the manufacturing costs, making it suitable for low resource settings, such as point-of-care testing in the developing countries.

					<b>3. Sample preparation for a quantum biomolecular sensing platform</b>
					<br/>
					We propose a three-component sample preparation platform for delivering proteins, with controlled orientation, purified from a complex biological sample to a sensor surface. The presented platform depletes highly abundant proteins and cells from complex biological samples, and then is capable of immobilizing the target analyte on the surface with controlled immobilization. A herringbone structure is used to mix the sample with micron-sized beads coated with antibodies against the highly abundant proteins, which is then fed into a second component, consisting of a filter trench with interdigitated electrodes above for applying dielectrophoretic force.  The beads and cells are pushed down into the filter trench, thus allowing only the serum to pass through.  In a third step, protein orientation and immobilization is controlled with electric field.
